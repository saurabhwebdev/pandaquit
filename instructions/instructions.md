I want to make a react app named quitter. I have installed firebase and react app and tailwind so you dont need to install them.  This app will use tailwind for styling and firebase for backend authentication and data storage and other things as well. Make the app modern and sleek and beautiful.

The application will have following features:

1. Login/Signup with email and password and Google signup as well also have forgot password feature
2. Once the user login he/she is redirected to the onboarding flow page. This page will take the suers smoking habits like total cigarettes smoked in one day, total cigarettes in one packet, price of one packet, also add currency selector and have inr in it by default currency and the last field will be total year since smoking. Also once the form is filled take that time and date by default as the quit time and date
3. After the onboarding is done then redirect the users to the dashboard where you show the Realtime stats since the user has stopped smoking. The stats must emphasise on Money saved and other things, but prime focus will be on the money saved and how much the user want to save and how much has been saved and other things like achievements for health and money and all he relevant things on he dashboard but make sure everything is updating in real-time every second for the first hour and then every minute.
4. have a detailed profile page based on the data filled by user during the onboarding flow and show stats on profile page as well.
5. Add a berating page which will provide user with the guided breathing exercise
6. Add coping mechanisms
7. make sure everything looks beautiful amazing interactive and beautiful and Modern and sleek and minimal
8. Aso make sure to have required navbar and footer for the app
9. On top of the application ad a nice landing page which has call to action to redirect user to the login page.
